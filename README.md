# 🪼 AI-Driven Early Warning Systems for Marine Stingers (Computer Vision Models)

## 📖 Overview
This project focuses on developing an **AI-based early warning system** to predict **bluebottle (Physalia physalis)** beaching events along the Australian coastline. Bluebottles are passive drifters carried by **winds, waves, and currents**, causing painful stings and posing a significant **public safety risk**.

By integrating **environmental reanalysis data** (wind, waves, currents, and temperature) with **observed bluebottle occurrences**, the project applies **computer vision and spatiotemporal modeling** to forecast high-risk events and understand key environmental drivers.

---

## 🧩 Objectives
- Build a **computer vision model** linking bluebottle presence to environmental conditions.  
- Apply a **patch-based learning approach** to capture offshore spatial context.  
- Analyze **spatiotemporal correlations** between environmental factors and sting events.  
- Deliver an **AI early warning system** capable of real-time prediction.

## 🧠 Methods
1. **Data Integration:** Combine bluebottle occurrence data with gridded reanalysis variables (wind, waves, currents).  
2. **Preprocessing:** Spatial-temporal alignment, normalization, and patch extraction.  
3. **Modeling:** Apply CNN or hybrid deep learning models for spatiotemporal prediction.  
4. **Evaluation:** Use metrics like precision, recall, and AUC to assess model accuracy.  
5. **Visualization:** Generate daily risk maps highlighting probable sting areas.
